Repo for the class E484 - Scientific Visualization, for the final project

## Data Source
This project uses data from the *NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies* and we are analyzing the *Land-Ocean Temperature Index, ERSSTv5, 1200km smoothing* data to look at surface air temperature anomaly data. This data is an estimate of global surface temerature change. 

## Other Resources
Our main tool is Paraview and we are using the *NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies* G.Projector - Map Projections as a resource inside of Paraview. The G.Projector transforms an input map image into any of about 200 global and regional map projections. This is being placed in the pipeline inside of Paraview as an overlay on the data to make the globe look like a map.
