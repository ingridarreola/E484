# Data Literacy
An Open source project aimed to make students more data literate. This repository will house lessons as they created, with the purpose of focusing on data literacy.

# Data Literacy Lessons
This repo will also house the lessons that will be used to create a curriculum for students to learn more about data, understanding data foundations, and increase their literacy. These lessons will be created with reveal.js, which is a javascript library that makes it easy to create slides online. Next this will be hosted on a website and available to everyone.

# Sources
These lessons are being created in collaboration with community groups, data professionals, and teachers. The sources will be noted on the slides, many of these are coming from books that focus on data, data visualization, visual information, and graphicacy. The sources will be updated as the curriculum itself is updated.

# Reveal.js
The data literacy curriculum is being built with reveal.js, which is an open source HTML presentation framework. It enables anyone with a web browser to create fully featured and beautiful presentations for free. [Check out the live demo](https://revealjs.com/).
